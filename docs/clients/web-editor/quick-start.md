# Quick Start

If you just want to _use_ it, simply head to the deployed version: https://editor.develop.eoepca.org/

If you want to set it up yourself, there is a Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/eoepca/processing-editor

The source code is on Github: https://github.com/EOEPCA/processing-editor
See there for instructions on how to run it.

The deployed version runs on the EOEPCA Kubernetes Cluster through a Helm chart in conjunction with ArgoCD. See the Configuration section of these docs for more information on this.
