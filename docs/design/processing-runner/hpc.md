# High-Performance Computing (HPC) Processing Runner

HPC systems are designed to handle and process large-scale data computations, making them highly suitable for the data-intensive nature of EO processing tasks. The use of HPC can significantly reduce processing time for complex computations, thereby increasing efficiency and throughput. In this context, Slurm emerges as a powerful and flexible workload manager. 

It enables effective job scheduling, resource allocation, and cluster management, which are crucial for optimising the performance of HPC environments in processing EO data.
