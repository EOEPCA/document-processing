# Docker Processing Runner

While the Kubernetes Processing Runner targets the execution of processing workflows on Kubernetes clusters, the Docker Processing Runner targets the execution of processing workflows on computing resources that can rely on container engines such as docker or podman to run the workflow containerized command line tools.

Containers are isolated environments that contain all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files required to run an application. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different computing environments, from a developer's local laptop to high-capacity cloud servers, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. Containers are lightweight, making them ideal for creating scalable, efficient, and secure application deployments.
